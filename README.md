## TUTORIALS

In this section, I've documented all the explainations and steps required to complete the FabLab course and assignments.

### SECTIONAL CONTENTS 

### GITHUB

#### BASIC INFORMATION

- What is GitHub?

  GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

  GitHub offers both plans for private and free repositories on the same account which are commonly used to host open-source software projects. As of April 2017, GitHub reports having almost 20 million users and 57 million repositories, making it the largest host of source code in the world.

- What is a repository?

  A repository, or “repo” for short, is a digital directory or storage space where you can access your project, its files, and all the versions of its files that Git saves. It can be made and use easily on GitHHub and can be used to display our documented files online to other users.
  
- What is a commit?

  A commit is like a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time.
  
  When you created your new repository, you initialized it with a README file. README files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your README file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.
  
- What is Markdown?

  Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

### MANOEUVRE

- CREATING A GITHUB ID
- CREATING A GITHUB PAGE (REPOSITORY)
  - **STEP 1**: In the upper-right corner of any page, click , and then click New repository.
  - **STEP 2**: Type a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "myname.github.io".
  - **STEP 3**: Optionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub."
  - **STEP 4**: Choose between creating a public or private repository.
  
  `Public` repositories are a great choice for getting started. They're visible to any user on GitHub, so you can benefit from a collaborative community.
  
  `Private` repositories require a little more setup. They're only available to you, the repository owner, as well as any collaborators you choose to share with. Private repositories are only available for paid accounts. For more information, see "GitHub's billing plans."
  - **STEP 5**: Select Initialize this repository with a README.
  - **STEP 6**: Click Create repository.

- CHOOSING A THEME
  - **STEP 1**: Go to `Settings` tab in your repository.
  - **STEP 2**: Scroll down to the section "GitHub Pages".
  - **STEP 3**: Click on "Choose a theme" button.
  - **STEP 4**: Click on any desired theme.
  - **STEP 5**: Click on "Select theme" button.
  - **STEP 6**: Click on "Commit a new file" button.
  
- COMMITING A CHANGE IN .md FILE
  - **STEP 1**: In your repository's list of files, click `README.md`.
  - **STEP 2**: Above the file's content, click on Edit icon
  - **STEP 3**: On the `Edit file` tab , type some information about yourself. The guide for leaning about markdown is availabe [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
  - **STEP 4**: Above the new content, click `Preview changes`.
  - **STEP 5**: Review the changes you made to the file. You'll see the new content in green.
  - **STEP 6**: At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file.
  - **STEP 7**: Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is `master`, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request.
  - **STEP 8**: Click `Propose file change`.
